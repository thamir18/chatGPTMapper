# chatGPTMapper

The ChatGPT Mapper is a Python script designed to map sensitive words before sending requests to the ChatGPT server. This script proves useful in various scenarios where the presence of tagged sensitive words does not impact the processing of ChatGPT. These scenarios may include tasks such as drafting executive reports, fine-tuning model responses, rewriting emails, and rephrasing contextual information.
